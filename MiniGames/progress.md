- Working on the CSS with the train theme

### Othello
- Complimentary colours for UI- colour codes needed
#### Stuff needed from specialist duckies-
- Duckies with two different colour hats/ scarf – as pieces- high priority
- Suggestion for “pond”  board- similar to image below but simpler with less elements

We have three power ups as duckies- 
1) speed ducky- gives extra chance
2) bomb ducky- removes the pieces that touch the selected piece
3) shield ducky- doesn’t allow the turning of the piece
