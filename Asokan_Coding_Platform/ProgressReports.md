# Progress Reports

## **Week-One**

### **1. Completed Tasks**

1)  **Project Definition**:
    
    -   The project's primary goal, scope, and unique features have been clearly defined.
    -   The gamified concept inspired by _Squid Game_ has been finalized.
2)  **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**:
    
    -   A detailed SRS has been created, including:
        -   Functional requirements for the code editor, problem display, and test case execution.
        -   Non-functional requirements, such as performance, usability, compatibility, security, and scalability.
        -   A clear description of the _Squid Game_ mechanics in the context of test case visualization.
    -   Constraints and assumptions for the project have been documented.

----------

### **2. Next Steps**

1)  **Technical Architecture and Design**:
    
    -   Define the system architecture, including the frontend, backend, and code execution engine.
    -   Choose the technology stack (e.g., React.js for frontend, Node.js or Python for backend, and Docker or similar for the sandboxed code execution engine).
2)  **Development Planning**:
    
    -   Break down the project into milestones and tasks.
    -   Allocate resources and create a timeline for implementation.
3)  **Frontend UI Prototyping**:
    
    -   Design the user interface for the code editor and gamified test case execution.
    -   Focus on visualizing the "Red Light, Green Light" mechanics effectively.
4)  **Backend Setup**:
    
    -   Set up a basic backend to handle code submissions and execute test cases in a sandboxed environment.
5)  **Integration of Test Case Visualization**:
    
    -   Begin implementing the game mechanics and connect them to test case execution results.

----------

### **3. Challenges and Risks**

1)  **Real-Time Synchronization**:
    
    -   Ensuring smooth synchronization between the backend test case execution and frontend visualization in real-time.
2)  **Sandboxed Code Execution**:
    
    -   Handling code execution securely while preventing malicious activities or resource overuse.
3)  **User Engagement**:
    
    -   Designing an intuitive and engaging interface that conveys the test case results clearly.

----------

### **4. Conclusion**

We have successfully completed the initial phase of the project, including defining the scope and creating the SRS. The next steps involve technical design, UI prototyping, and backend development.

With the SRS in place, we are well-positioned to begin the implementation phase and deliver a functional, engaging platform.

## **Week-Two**

### **1. Completed Tasks**

1)  **Coding Editor Frontend**:
    
    -   The coding editor UI's development is completed.
    -   Integration with mock APIs is completed.

2) **Squid Game Animation**:

    -    The squid game animation is complete.

----------

### **2. Next Steps**

1)  **Integration of new assets in squid game animation**
2)  **Integration of mock APIs for squid game**
3)  **Backend development**

----------

### **3. Conclusion**

We have successfully completed the next phase of the project, with squid game animation as well as coding editor UI ready. We are now planning the next phase of the project, that is integration of various frontend components and backend development.


## **Week-Three**

### **1. Completed Tasks**

1)  **Backend**:
    
    -   API for fetching questions from MongoDB and for checking user's code against test cases.

----------

### **2. Next Steps**

1)  **Integration of new assets in squid game animation**
2)  **Integration of mock APIs for squid game**
3)  **Integrating frontend components**

----------

### **3. Conclusion**

We have successfully completed the next phase of the project, with the complete backend ready. We are now planning the next phase of the project, that is integration of various frontend components and API integration.
